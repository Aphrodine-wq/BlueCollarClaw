## ⚙️ Setup GitHub Analysis

### Step 1: Add Your GitHub Username

Edit `pulse-check/pulse-config.json`:

```json
{
  "github_username": "your-actual-username"
}
```

**OR** set environment variable:
```bash
# Add to .env or system environment
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-username
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Add GitHub Token for Private Repos

Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Permissions needed:
- `repo` (if you want private repos)
- `read:user`

Then add to environment:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourTokenHere
```

Without token = public repos only
With token = all repos + issues
